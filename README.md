# ✈️ Flight Delay Predictor

A machine learning-based application that predicts the likelihood of flight delays based on historical flight data and various flight attributes.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build and deploy a predictive model that can estimate whether a flight will be delayed. It uses machine learning techniques on real-world flight datasets to learn patterns and generate predictions. This tool could assist airlines, passengers, or logistic systems in planning better and avoiding disruptions.

## 🔍 Features

- Load and preprocess flight data
- Train/test machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Predict flight delay likelihood
- Visualize feature importance and results
- Export predictions and evaluation metrics
